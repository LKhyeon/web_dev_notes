When working with Django, it is recommended to create a python virtual environment.
For this reason, the following codes were executed to set up a virtual environment with Django.

    ... $ python3 -m venv env
    ... $ source env/bin/activate
    (env) ...$ python -m pip install Django

Deactivating virtual environment is 

    (env) ... $ deactivate
